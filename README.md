## Cozco Backoffice Frontend 

Welcome to the Cozco Backoffice Frontend! This project is your gateway to managing all the back-office operations for Cozco, built with the power of React and a dash of creativity.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts to make your development experience cozy and productive:

npm start

Fire up the app in development mode with:


npm start

Open http://localhost:3000 in your favorite browser to see the magic happen. The app will automatically reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

npm test
Launch the test runner with:


npm test
Run interactive tests and ensure your code is as cozy as it can be! For more details on running tests, check out the testing documentation.

npm run build
Build the app for production with:


npm run build
This command bundles React in production mode, optimizing the build for the best performance. The output goes into the build folder, ready to be deployed. Your build will be minified, and the filenames will include hashes for optimal caching.

npm run eject
Feeling adventurous? eject gives you full control over the build tools and configuration:


npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! Use this if you need customization beyond what Create React App offers out of the box.
